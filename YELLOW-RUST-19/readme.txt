*****YELLOW-RUST-19 DATABASE

A team of researchers from Turkey in collaboration with experts have created a database of yellow rust in wheat with different severity levels.
The Data Set consists of raw and pre-processed (YELLOW-RUST-19) images with categories of healthy and yellow rust diseased leaf images. It is foreseen that the data set will guide related studies in the area.
The sowed area belongs to the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Directorate of Field Crops Central Research Institute and is reserved for fungus disease experiments on cereals, especially yellow rust in wheat. The area is located near Haymana-Ankara in Turkey. The sowing was completed between October and November 2018.

Severity level images from the dataset:
No disease (0: No signs of infection),
Resistant (R: Minor signs of infection),
Moderately Resistant (MR: Small and medium signs of infection),
Moderately Resistant—Moderately Susceptible (MRMS),
Moderately Susceptible (MS: Medium signs of infection) and 
Susceptible (S: Major signs of infection)
